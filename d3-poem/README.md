# D3.js

### Exercise from the "Learn D3" Course on CodeCademy.
The purpose of this lesson is to go through the 4 basic steps of the D3 design pattern:

1) Create a selection using `.select()` or `.selectAll()`
2) Use `.data()` method to associate data with that selection
3) Append elements to the DOM using `.enter()` and `.append()`
4) Modify the elements based on the data using `.attr()` and `.style()`
